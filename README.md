Key Steps:

Data Cleaning & SQL Analysis:

Imported raw Zomato data into SQL databases.
Cleaned and transformed data using SQL queries, including JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregations to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data.
Analyzed key attributes such as restaurant name, location, cuisine, user ratings, and price range.
SQL Queries for Insights:

Extracted insights such as:
Top-performing restaurants based on ratings and reviews.
Popular cuisines in different cities.
Rating trends and distribution across price ranges and restaurant categories.
Power BI Dashboard:

Built interactive dashboards displaying metrics like average ratings by city, reviews per restaurant, and pricing trends.
Used slicers and drill-through features to allow users to filter by city, cuisine, and other factors.
Tableau Dashboard:

Created dynamic dashboards to visualize geographical trends (heatmaps), restaurant performance, and customer review patterns.
Included filters and interactive features for real-time data exploration.
Skills and Tools Used:

SQL for data extraction and manipulation.
Power BI and Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Data cleaning, aggregation, and trend analysis.
Conclusion: This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for data manipulation and how Power BI and Tableau enable the creation of insightful, interactive dashboards. The visualizations provide valuable insights for analyzing restaurant performance, customer preferences, and regional trends.
